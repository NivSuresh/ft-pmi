        "<i>Pehr Gyllenhammar led Volvo for nearly 24 years, from 1971 to 1994. His tenure was mostly successful, and he left the company in strong health, with a global reputation for innovation and safety. </i>\n" +
        "<p>Gyllenhammar then watched in discomfort as Volvo entered a difficult phase. In 1999, the company sold its passenger car division to Ford for $6.5 billion. Despite the introduction of several new models, the US giant struggled to maintain profitability. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Ford’s wider business came under pressure and the Volvo unit was put up for sale. In 2010, China's Geely Automotive Holdings acquired it for just $1.8 billion – more than 70 percent lower than its last price</p>\n" +
        "<p>This was painful for Gyllenhammar to witness. &ldquo;In my perception, the company and brand that I had worked so hard to safeguard and grow were gone,&rdquo; he wrote in 2019.</p>\n" +
        "<p>But it was not over. <span class='quote left'>By 2025, half of its cars will be electric, and it will have cut its carbon impact by 25% across all operations and suppliers</span> Many believed Volvo would end up on the scrapheap alongside fellow Swedish carmaker Saab, but Geely&rsquo;s entrepreneurial chairman Li Shufu had other ideas: his group would give Volvo financial security and access to the Chinese market. He allowed the new division to operate independently, with freedom over its designs and strategy. He also let the brand stay close to its roots. The headquarters remained in Sweden, and Geely let Volvo keep its DNA: its emphasis on quality, safety, and eye-catching design. </p>\n" +
        "<p>By early 2017, sales and profits were outstripping expectations, and many leaders would have said that the transformation was complete. But this is where Volvo&rsquo;s story teaches us three important lessons:</p>\n" +
        "<h3>Successful companies don&rsquo;t rest on their laurels</h3>\n" +
        "<p>He had just brought the company back from the brink, but Volvo&rsquo;s CEO H&aring;kan Samuelsson was not ready to stop innovating. Just when the company seemed to have found some stability, he and his leadership team chose to disrupt the company once again.&nbsp;</p>\n" +
        "<p>In mid-2017, Volvo announced that from 2019 all new models would be either electric or hybrid-electric, which would end more than 90 years of pure petrol- or diesel-powered car production. <span class='quote'>Even as the Covid-19 pandemic slowed the global economy to a crawl, Volvo did not consider deviating from its transformative strategy</span></p>\n" +
        "<p>While the company was in good shape, Volvo&rsquo;s leadership recognized that public perception of electric cars was shifting, and so was the way the major economies were planning to regulate vehicle emissions. Market analysts &ndash; then and now &ndash; see these two forces working in tandem, with regulatory forces helping to build momentum between 2025 and 2030, before becoming less important in the 2030s as consumer demand grows stronger. Over the same period, the cost of electric cars is expected to fall as the technology develops and the market scales up.&nbsp;</p>\n" +
        "<p>Samuelsson and his team reasoned that it could use Volvo&rsquo;s renewed financial strength to adapt the business to those market shifts and gain an early-mover advantage. It was a compelling plan, and this time Gyllenhammar approved. &ldquo;I have always felt it imperative for business leaders to be willing to go against the status quo and champion the kind of aggressive change that can pay off in the long term,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n" +
        "<h3>Successful transformation demands total commitment</h3>\n" +
        "<p>After unveiling its first all-electric vehicle in 2019, Volvo made a series of new pledges to demonstrate the company&rsquo;s total commitment to its electrification and decarbonization strategy. By 2025, half of its cars will be electric, and it will have cut its carbon impact by 25% across all operations and suppliers.</p>\n" +
        "<p>Even as the Covid-19 pandemic slowed the global economy to a crawl, Volvo did not consider deviating from its transformative strategy. &ldquo;We will not compromise on our electrification strategy,&rdquo; Head of Strategy M&aring;rten Levenstam told <em>Wired</em>. &ldquo;Electrification is Volvo&rsquo;s path forward, and we will continue our plans to electrify our product range.&rdquo;</p>\n" +
        "<h3>The easy option is rarely the best</h3>\n" +
        "<p> Many carmakers are dabbling in electric vehicles, but none of the traditional industry players have committed so strongly to an electric future. They have reason to be cautious: pioneering electric vehicle maker Tesla has not had a profitable year since it was founded in 2003.&nbsp; </p>\n" +
        "<p>The challenges include costs, range, charging times, regulatory hurdles and a lack of adequate charging facilities. But Volvo is playing the long game. It sees that the end of petrol and diesel is coming, and when the tide moves strongly towards electric, it will be some way ahead of most of its competitors.&nbsp;</p>\n" +
        "<p>For now, Gyllenhammar can rest a bit easier: in 2019, Volvo achieved its sixth consecutive year of record sales, with 705,452 cars sold. &ldquo;The company is demonstrating the kind of strategic thinking that is necessary to establish long-term viability in a challenging and changing market,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;And to capitalize on industry disrupters to the benefit of both shareholders and consumers alike.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n" +

        "<p>About 30 years ago, the world&rsquo;s first offshore wind farm was erected just off the Danish island of Lolland. It was an experimental project, and many observers were skeptical. Wind energy was expensive and building installations in salty offshore conditions seemed to make them less viable. But Vindeby Offshore Wind Farm would eventually prove to be a crucial step in the development of one of today&rsquo;s most impressive companies.</p>\n" +
        "<p>&Oslash;rsted is a world leader in green energy, specializing in offshore and onshore wind farms, solar farms, energy storage and bioenergy plants. <span class='quote left'>The industry has advanced considerably since those 11 turbines were installed 25 years ago: today, its entire output can be matched by just one large modern turbine.</span> It has won numerous accolades for sustainability and climate action. But just 10 years ago &ndash; when it was known as DONG Energy (Danish Oil and Natural Gas) &ndash; it was one of the most polluting companies in Europe, known for building and operating coal-fired power plants and offshore oil and gas.</p>\n" +
        "<p>The high-level story of &Oslash;rsted&rsquo;s self-disruption is well known: in 2008, the company initiated a bold transformation plan that would see it halve its carbon emissions inside a decade. A 98% reduction is now targeted for 2025. The emphasis is often, justifiably, on how the company drove change proactively as climate change was proven to be accelerating, and societal, political and corporate attitudes towards fossil fuels were hardening. However, there are three important parts of &Oslash;rsted&rsquo;s story that are often overlooked:</p>\n" +
        "<h3>The company had to go to war with itself</h3>\n" +
        "<p>&Oslash;rsted needed to disassemble, divest and repurpose the very core of its business. It was a world leader in some areas, particularly coal power plant construction, and had many senior, influential people who were committed to careers in fossil fuels. This meant that there was significant internal resistance to the change. Overcoming it took determination and deep confidence in the vision for future growth.&nbsp;</p>\n" +
        "<p>In 2008, climate change skepticism was more widespread than it is today. The Kyoto Protocol, the first international, legally binding framework on emissions targets, had only been in place for three years. Denmark and most of Europe were parties to it, and the leaders at DONG Energy rightly expected the global energy transition to gain momentum. By the time of the Paris Agreement in 2016, which saw countries agree to cooperate long term to mitigate global warming, few in the company would have had any reservations about the strategy.</p>\n" +
        "<div class='content__item-text__img -large'><img src='https://ft.com/brandsuite/scienceofselfdisruption/imgs/article1/a1-article-1.jpg'/></div>" +
        "<h3>Communicating the change has been critical to success</h3>\n" +
        "<p>In 2009, the then state-owned DONG Energy had not managed to tell the world that it had started its green energy transformation. Copenhagen was hosting the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Summit, but the world&rsquo;s media would not print stories about DONG&rsquo;s transformation plan. <span class='quote'>Ørsted needed to disassemble, divest and repurpose the very core of its business.</span>  Instead, the media emphasized what it saw as an irony: the host of a landmark climate change conference, Denmark, had one of the most polluting energy systems in Europe, and its own energy company was responsible for most of it.&nbsp;</p>\n" +
        "<p>Since then, &Oslash;rsted has become better at publicizing its strategy, and it went on to win over investors in its 2016 IPO. Today, the company is able to promote itself as a true &lsquo;black to green&rsquo; energy success story, and this has been recognized: it has been named the world&rsquo;s most sustainable energy company in 2020, by the NGO Corporate Knights.&nbsp;</p>\n" +
        "<p>Importantly, &Oslash;rsted is not just talking up past successes. It continues to communicate its future plans &ndash; including, most recently, a commitment to achieving carbon-neutral operations and energy production by 2025.</p>\n" +
        "<h3>The transformation began long before it officially started</h3>\n" +
        "<p>If &Oslash;rsted had not been pioneering and experimenting with offshore wind, including that crucial first project at Vindeby, it would not have had the confidence or expertise it needed to invest so heavily in its transformation.</p>\n" +
        "<p>We often hear about &Oslash;rsted&rsquo;s 10 years of rapid transformation from 2008 to 2018, and the ambitious plans it has for the future, but before 2008 there were close to two decades of effort that sowed the seeds for its success. &ldquo;For each new wind farm,&rdquo; says Head of Strategy and Communication Jakob Askou B&oslash;ss, &ldquo;we have focused on systematically driving down costs by developing larger sites and installing larger turbines, innovating design and installation processes, and helping to make the industry&rsquo;s supply chain more mature.&rdquo;</p>\n" +
        "<p>Vindeby Offshore Wind Farm was dismantled in 2017. The industry has advanced considerably since those 11 turbines were installed 25 years ago: today, its entire output can be matched by just one large modern turbine. &Oslash;rsted learned a great deal from the project &ndash; even at the end: the world&rsquo;s first offshore wind farm was also the first to be decommissioned, which meant &Oslash;rsted could perform an evaluation of the environmental consequences of removing an offshore wind farm. Another green milestone for a company that was once one of the biggest polluters in Europe.</p>\n" +

        "<h3>What’s the difference between disruption and self-disruption?</h3>\n" +
        "<p>They are two very different things. You're either disrupting others, or you’re on the receiving end of disruption – if it’s the latter, you have to react. Whether it’s changes to regulation, a pandemic, or an economic shock, responses vary. Some companies disappear altogether, and some survive and transform through the disruption.</p>\n" +
        "<p>Self-disruption is about being mindful, paying attention to details, anticipating threats, and making proactive changes. It means creating internal, controlled mini-crises to prevent being surprised by a big looming crisis. Self-disruptors do this regularly to keep their teams sharp.</p>\n" +
        "<p>The mindset of self-disruption is not easy to implement and integrate into a [firm’s] culture.  But it's a way of survival. Look at the companies that have disappeared from the Fortune 500 over the past 10 years: in many cases, their downfall was due to a lack of self-awareness.</p>\n" +
        "<h3>What does self-disruption mean in practice?</h3>\n" +
        "<p>You disrupt your business model and you constantly challenge yourself: do we still have a compelling value proposition? Do we still delight customers? Are we staying ahead of the competition? You avoid being in sleep mode, waiting for markets or external forces to dictate your disruption. </p>\n" +
        "<p>But staying awake requires a lot of courage from leadership. And you can’t necessarily rely on a C-suite leader who is 10 years from retirement. Are they going to put everything at stake? You have to develop these capabilities internally: in the way you plan strategically, sense the market, and anticipate threats. Not every company can do this.</p>\n" +
        "<p>Some companies make acquisitions in order to self-disrupt, but I’d rather develop a mindset from the inside. A lot of businesses have people with vision, but they fail to translate that imagination into concrete steps within the organization. The best know something nobody else knows, and they make sure they act on it.</p>\n" +
        "<h3>What skills do companies to self-disrupt?</h3>\n" +
        "<p>Part of the role I play in Thales is to span boundaries. I’ll go outside our boundaries to sense what's happening in industries that are very far from the core business: “This is what’s happening in the entertainment business, and this is what could mean for us in five years.” You look at companies that are making diversification and strategic moves that are not being triggered by current market conditions.</p>\n" +
        "<p>This goes back to the paper by <a href='https://hbr.org/2009/12/the-innovators-dna'>Clayton Christensen</a> on the innovator&rsquo;s DNA. You need the ability to associate, network, sense, and connect things. And those are skills you find in very innovative, creative people, with different sets of skills as far as business acumen is concerned. It depends on the cultural DNA of the company, but typically these people are in innovation or strategic-planning teams.</p>\n" +
        "<h3>How do you avoid complacency?</h3>\n" +
        "<p>Typically, companies that are profitable and have very deep roots in legacy businesses tend to avoid introspection and tend to be in autopilot mode. But they need to embrace skeptics and naysayers. They need to defer to experts who have the real knowledge, and they need to trust them. They need cognitive diversity: the ability to challenge each other candidly without getting into conflict. <span class='quote left'>A lot of businesses have people with vision, but they fail to translate that imagination into concrete steps within the organization. </span> Diversity on the board is as important as diversity in the C-suite to be able to self-disrupt.</p>\n" +
        "<p>Successful companies accept that they have different opinions, but converge towards a vision. Everybody used to look at GE and 3M as machines of self-disruption. They managed the portfolio, they divested when it was high, and reinvested. 3M is still doing this. It’s a way of life because it has an ingrained spirit of innovation.</p>\n" +
        "<p>That&rsquo;s harder in companies with a traditional engineering focus, that are product-oriented and serving traditional markets. At Thales, we have invested a lot in international development (including building local footprint abroad) because we see the future outside of the big eight countries that we typically play in. And we've made big bets in predictable and reliable AI &ndash; we call it <a href='https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/journalist/thales-podcasts'>TrUE AI</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n" +
        "<h3>How do you avoid becoming an industry follower?</h3>\n" +
        "<p>Most often, a market leader makes the first move and then others tend to follow. The key is to do this before it's too destructive for the industry or before passing the point of no return. The airline industry is an example where they constantly price too low and enter a bidding war. If you look at the US market, there are only four major airlines. That consolidation could be a consequence of a lack of self-disruption.</p>\n" +
        "<p>In contrast, Volvo has stated that it is aiming for five million direct consumer relationships by 2025. It’s a bold move in a traditional sector – breaking the dealership structure – but often, that’s just the kind of strategy you need.</p>\n" +

The company had a new purpose: to focus its resources on products that are less harmful than continued smoking. The majority of harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke come from burning tobacco, not the tobacco itself, so PMI focused on removing combustion. This led to the creation of smoke-free alternatives that can make acceptable alternatives for those adults who would otherwise continue to smoke.</p>\n" +
        "<p>However, fulfilling this new purpose means reinventing the company and steering it through unknown waters. As Deepak Mishra, PMI’s chief strategy officer says: “We are trying to disrupt our own industry, something which is as inspirational as it is complicated.”</p>\n" +
        "<h3>Goals beyond profits</h3>\n" +
        "<p>So what is the motivation behind such a major shift? According to estimates from the World Health Organization, more than 1 billion people will continue to smoke in 2025<sup>[1]</sup>. Yet, smoking prevention and cessation programs coupled with the array of scientifically substantiated smoke-free alternatives, can make cigarettes obsolete in the near future. “With the right regulatory encouragement and support from civil society,” says André Calantzopoulos, CEO of PMI, “we believe cigarette sales can end within 10 to 15 years in many countries.”<span class='quote'>“We are not talking about a small change; we are talking about a big transformation.” <span class='quote-author'>Jacek Olczak, PMI’s Chief Operating Officer</span></span> </p>\n" +
        "<p>What is important is that legal and regulatory frameworks allow for this. Typically, the pace of product innovation moves faster than regulations. In some industries this does not have a material impact on progress, but in other areas it can represent a major barrier. As Daniel Malan, Assistant Professor of Business Ethics at Trinity Business School, points out: “Regulators seem to be confused by the technology, the speed of change and the ethical implications of new products that do not fit into existing categories.”<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n" +
        "<p>Malan refers to a white paper from the World Economic Forum that suggests a way of dealing with this issue: “The Forum’s white paper argues that the best way to ensure positive outcomes in such a complicated environment is to operate with a clear foundation of values, for example, by focusing on basic principles like human dignity and the common good.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n" +
        "<h3>Disrupting the culture</h3>\n" +
        "<p>PMI is clear that the best choice for adult smokers is to quit tobacco and nicotine altogether. But for those that do not, there are better alternatives, and PMI believes that with the right regulation that helps adult smokers get access to and accurate information about better alternatives, many countries could be smoke-free in 10-15 years.</p>\n" +
        "<p><figure class='inline-article-image -left'><img src='https://ft.com/brandsuite/scienceofselfdisruption/imgs/article04/jacek-olczak-1.jpg'><figcaption>Jacek Olczak, <br> COO, <br> Philip Morris International</figcaption></figure>However, Michael Kunst, Senior Vice President for Commercial Transformation at PMI, says that simply relying on a product to drive the business will no longer be enough. To discover how organizations achieve long-term success amid disruption, PMI needed to explore the wider implications of the changes. This led them to study the pathways forged by companies in completely different industries.</p>\n" +
        "<p>“If you look at the technology, media or entertainment industries, or even retail, there are good examples of companies that we can turn to for inspiration; to see how they differentiate in a world that gets more crowded by the day with information overflow,” says Kunst.</p>\n" +
        "<p>While the businesses in other industries are different, many of the same challenges, opportunities and success factors are relevant. Being open to new areas has been important to PMI’s reinvention. “If you compare how the voice of the company was thought of five years ago, or even three years ago, the difference is like night and day, in terms of how we’ve opened up and are inviting conversations with others,” says PMI’s Chief Operating Officer Jacek Olczak.</p>\n" +
        "<p>“We’ve opened up the windows, we’ve opened up the doors, we’ve let the outside world in,” says Marian Salzman, PMI’s senior vice president for global communications, <figure class='inline-article-image -right'><img src='https://ft.com/brandsuite/scienceofselfdisruption/imgs/article04/marian-salzman.jpg'><figcaption>Marian Salzman, <br> Senior Vice President, <br> Global Comms, <br> Philip Morris International</figcaption></figure> “We’ve taken some bruises, but more often than not, we’ve come out better for the fact that we’ve engaged with this bigger, broader world. And I think we’ve become part of the ongoing dialogue around harm reduction, around companies that can change, around workforces that are becoming more inclusive and diverse.”</p>\n" +
        "<h3>Investing in a long-term vision</h3>\n" +
        "<p>Of course, self-disruption does not happen overnight. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 7.2 billion into the development and commercialization of smoke-free products. <sup>[4]</sup> The company now employs more than 400 scientists, engineers, and technicians.</p>\n" +
        "<p>This investment is now driving the company’s transformation. PMI has grown net revenues from smoke-free products from 2.7% of overall revenue in 2016 to 18.7% in 2019, and aims for 38% to 42% by 2025. <sup>[5]</sup> By that time, it hopes at least 40 million adult smokers will have switched to smoke-free products.</p>\n" +
        "<p>Self-disruption can – by design – affect an existing core business. This is the case for PMI, where smoke-free products are rapidly replacing cigarettes. This can be seen in the company’s results, where by the end of June 2020, year-to-date shipment volume of smoke-free products was up by 33.4%, while cigarette shipment volume was down by 11.4%. <sup>[6]</sup></p>\n" +
        "<p>“Transformation is enormously expensive,” says Martin King, CEO of PMI America. “Most startups get the chance to spend like crazy and everybody gives them a pass, but we have to deliver financial results at least as good as we used to, while investing in all the transformation.”</p>\n" +
        "<p>PMI is working full speed to deliver a smoke-free future. This can happen faster if conversations and debate center on data and scientific evidence, and if governments create regulations that acknowledge these smoke-free products are better than continued smoking and encourage adults who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to them.</p>\n" +
        "<p>Investment, scientific research, communication, external stakeholder engagement, cultural change – all these aspects of self-disruption will need to continue for PMI to achieve its transformation objectives. While there has been progress along PMI’s self-disruption path to date, Kunst says there is still much to do: “It’s a massive change, and therefore it needs repetition, reinforcement, and continued support.”</p>\n" +
