				'<i>Pehr Gyllenhammar led Volvo for nearly 24 years, from 1971 to 1994. His tenure was mostly successful, and he left the company in strong health, with a global reputation for innovation and safety. </i>\n' +
				"<p>Gyllenhammar then watched in discomfort as Volvo entered a difficult phase. In 1999, the company sold its passenger car division to Ford for $6.5 billion. Despite the introduction of several new models, the US giant struggled to maintain profitability. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Ford’s wider business came under pressure and the Volvo unit was put up for sale. In 2010, China's Geely Automotive Holdings acquired it for just $1.8 billion – more than 70 percent lower than its last price</p>\n" +
				'<p>This was painful for Gyllenhammar to witness. &ldquo;In my perception, the company and brand that I had worked so hard to safeguard and grow were gone,&rdquo; he wrote in 2019.</p>\n' +
				"<p>But it was not over. <span class='quote left'>By 2025, half of its cars will be electric, and it will have cut its carbon impact by 25% across all operations and suppliers</span> Many believed Volvo would end up on the scrapheap alongside fellow Swedish carmaker Saab, but Geely&rsquo;s entrepreneurial chairman Li Shufu had other ideas: his group would give Volvo financial security and access to the Chinese market. He allowed the new division to operate independently, with freedom over its designs and strategy. He also let the brand stay close to its roots. The headquarters remained in Sweden, and Geely let Volvo keep its DNA: its emphasis on quality, safety, and eye-catching design. </p>\n" +
				'<p>By early 2017, sales and profits were outstripping expectations, and many leaders would have said that the transformation was complete. But this is where Volvo&rsquo;s story teaches us three important lessons:</p>\n' +
				'<h3>Successful companies don&rsquo;t rest on their laurels</h3>\n' +
				'<p>He had just brought the company back from the brink, but Volvo&rsquo;s CEO H&aring;kan Samuelsson was not ready to stop innovating. Just when the company seemed to have found some stability, he and his leadership team chose to disrupt the company once again.&nbsp;</p>\n' +
				"<p>In mid-2017, Volvo announced that from 2019 all new models would be either electric or hybrid-electric, which would end more than 90 years of pure petrol- or diesel-powered car production. <span class='quote'>Even as the Covid-19 pandemic slowed the global economy to a crawl, Volvo did not consider deviating from its transformative strategy</span></p>\n" +
				'<p>While the company was in good shape, Volvo&rsquo;s leadership recognized that public perception of electric cars was shifting, and so was the way the major economies were planning to regulate vehicle emissions. Market analysts &ndash; then and now &ndash; see these two forces working in tandem, with regulatory forces helping to build momentum between 2025 and 2030, before becoming less important in the 2030s as consumer demand grows stronger. Over the same period, the cost of electric cars is expected to fall as the technology develops and the market scales up.&nbsp;</p>\n' +
				'<p>Samuelsson and his team reasoned that it could use Volvo&rsquo;s renewed financial strength to adapt the business to those market shifts and gain an early-mover advantage. It was a compelling plan, and this time Gyllenhammar approved. &ldquo;I have always felt it imperative for business leaders to be willing to go against the status quo and champion the kind of aggressive change that can pay off in the long term,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n' +
				'<h3>Successful transformation demands total commitment</h3>\n' +
				'<p>After unveiling its first all-electric vehicle in 2019, Volvo made a series of new pledges to demonstrate the company&rsquo;s total commitment to its electrification and decarbonization strategy. By 2025, half of its cars will be electric, and it will have cut its carbon impact by 25% across all operations and suppliers.</p>\n' +
				'<p>Even as the Covid-19 pandemic slowed the global economy to a crawl, Volvo did not consider deviating from its transformative strategy. &ldquo;We will not compromise on our electrification strategy,&rdquo; Head of Strategy M&aring;rten Levenstam told <em>Wired</em>. &ldquo;Electrification is Volvo&rsquo;s path forward, and we will continue our plans to electrify our product range.&rdquo;</p>\n' +
				'<h3>The easy option is rarely the best</h3>\n' +
				'<p> Many carmakers are dabbling in electric vehicles, but none of the traditional industry players have committed so strongly to an electric future. They have reason to be cautious: pioneering electric vehicle maker Tesla has not had a profitable year since it was founded in 2003.&nbsp; </p>\n' +
				'<p>The challenges include costs, range, charging times, regulatory hurdles and a lack of adequate charging facilities. But Volvo is playing the long game. It sees that the end of petrol and diesel is coming, and when the tide moves strongly towards electric, it will be some way ahead of most of its competitors.&nbsp;</p>\n' +
				'<p>For now, Gyllenhammar can rest a bit easier: in 2019, Volvo achieved its sixth consecutive year of record sales, with 705,452 cars sold. &ldquo;The company is demonstrating the kind of strategic thinking that is necessary to establish long-term viability in a challenging and changing market,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;And to capitalize on industry disrupters to the benefit of both shareholders and consumers alike.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n' +

				'<p>About 30 years ago, the world&rsquo;s first offshore wind farm was erected just off the Danish island of Lolland. It was an experimental project, and many observers were skeptical. Wind energy was expensive and building installations in salty offshore conditions seemed to make them less viable. But Vindeby Offshore Wind Farm would eventually prove to be a crucial step in the development of one of today&rsquo;s most impressive companies.</p>\n' +
				"<p>&Oslash;rsted is a world leader in green energy, specializing in offshore and onshore wind farms, solar farms, energy storage and bioenergy plants. <span class='quote left'>The industry has advanced considerably since those 11 turbines were installed 25 years ago: today, its entire output can be matched by just one large modern turbine.</span> It has won numerous accolades for sustainability and climate action. But just 10 years ago &ndash; when it was known as DONG Energy (Danish Oil and Natural Gas) &ndash; it was one of the most polluting companies in Europe, known for building and operating coal-fired power plants and offshore oil and gas.</p>\n" +
				'<p>The high-level story of &Oslash;rsted&rsquo;s self-disruption is well known: in 2008, the company initiated a bold transformation plan that would see it halve its carbon emissions inside a decade. A 98% reduction is now targeted for 2025. The emphasis is often, justifiably, on how the company drove change proactively as climate change was proven to be accelerating, and societal, political and corporate attitudes towards fossil fuels were hardening. However, there are three important parts of &Oslash;rsted&rsquo;s story that are often overlooked:</p>\n' +
				'<h3>The company had to go to war with itself</h3>\n' +
				'<p>&Oslash;rsted needed to disassemble, divest and repurpose the very core of its business. It was a world leader in some areas, particularly coal power plant construction, and had many senior, influential people who were committed to careers in fossil fuels. This meant that there was significant internal resistance to the change. Overcoming it took determination and deep confidence in the vision for future growth.&nbsp;</p>\n' +
				'<p>In 2008, climate change skepticism was more widespread than it is today. The Kyoto Protocol, the first international, legally binding framework on emissions targets, had only been in place for three years. Denmark and most of Europe were parties to it, and the leaders at DONG Energy rightly expected the global energy transition to gain momentum. By the time of the Paris Agreement in 2016, which saw countries agree to cooperate long term to mitigate global warming, few in the company would have had any reservations about the strategy.</p>\n' +
				"<div class='content__item-text__img -large'><img src='https://ft.com/brandsuite/scienceofselfdisruption/imgs/article1/a1-article-1.jpg'/></div>" +
				'<h3>Communicating the change has been critical to success</h3>\n' +
				"<p>In 2009, the then state-owned DONG Energy had not managed to tell the world that it had started its green energy transformation. Copenhagen was hosting the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Summit, but the world&rsquo;s media would not print stories about DONG&rsquo;s transformation plan. <span class='quote'>Ørsted needed to disassemble, divest and repurpose the very core of its business.</span>  Instead, the media emphasized what it saw as an irony: the host of a landmark climate change conference, Denmark, had one of the most polluting energy systems in Europe, and its own energy company was responsible for most of it.&nbsp;</p>\n" +
				'<p>Since then, &Oslash;rsted has become better at publicizing its strategy, and it went on to win over investors in its 2016 IPO. Today, the company is able to promote itself as a true &lsquo;black to green&rsquo; energy success story, and this has been recognized: it has been named the world&rsquo;s most sustainable energy company in 2020, by the NGO Corporate Knights.&nbsp;</p>\n' +
				'<p>Importantly, &Oslash;rsted is not just talking up past successes. It continues to communicate its future plans &ndash; including, most recently, a commitment to achieving carbon-neutral operations and energy production by 2025.</p>\n' +
				'<h3>The transformation began long before it officially started</h3>\n' +
				'<p>If &Oslash;rsted had not been pioneering and experimenting with offshore wind, including that crucial first project at Vindeby, it would not have had the confidence or expertise it needed to invest so heavily in its transformation.</p>\n' +
				'<p>We often hear about &Oslash;rsted&rsquo;s 10 years of rapid transformation from 2008 to 2018, and the ambitious plans it has for the future, but before 2008 there were close to two decades of effort that sowed the seeds for its success. &ldquo;For each new wind farm,&rdquo; says Head of Strategy and Communication Jakob Askou B&oslash;ss, &ldquo;we have focused on systematically driving down costs by developing larger sites and installing larger turbines, innovating design and installation processes, and helping to make the industry&rsquo;s supply chain more mature.&rdquo;</p>\n' +
				'<p>Vindeby Offshore Wind Farm was dismantled in 2017. The industry has advanced considerably since those 11 turbines were installed 25 years ago: today, its entire output can be matched by just one large modern turbine. &Oslash;rsted learned a great deal from the project &ndash; even at the end: the world&rsquo;s first offshore wind farm was also the first to be decommissioned, which meant &Oslash;rsted could perform an evaluation of the environmental consequences of removing an offshore wind farm. Another green milestone for a company that was once one of the biggest polluters in Europe.</p>\n' +

				'<i>Stephan Liozu, Chief Value Officer of Thales, on self-disruption, business survival, and the art of sensing the market</i>\n' +
				'<h3>What’s the difference between disruption and self-disruption?</h3>\n' +
				"<p>They are two very different things. You're either disrupting others, or you’re on the receiving end of disruption – if it’s the latter, you have to react. Whether it’s changes to regulation, a pandemic, or an economic shock, responses vary. Some companies disappear altogether, and some survive and transform through the disruption.</p>\n" +
				'<p>Self-disruption is about being mindful, paying attention to details, anticipating threats, and making proactive changes. It means creating internal, controlled mini-crises to prevent being surprised by a big looming crisis. Self-disruptors do this regularly to keep their teams sharp.</p>\n' +
				"<p>The mindset of self-disruption is not easy to implement and integrate into a [firm’s] culture.  But it's a way of survival. Look at the companies that have disappeared from the Fortune 500 over the past 10 years: in many cases, their downfall was due to a lack of self-awareness.</p>\n" +
				'<h3>What does self-disruption mean in practice?</h3>\n' +
				'<p>You disrupt your business model and you constantly challenge yourself: do we still have a compelling value proposition? Do we still delight customers? Are we staying ahead of the competition? You avoid being in sleep mode, waiting for markets or external forces to dictate your disruption. </p>\n' +
				'<p>But staying awake requires a lot of courage from leadership. And you can’t necessarily rely on a C-suite leader who is 10 years from retirement. Are they going to put everything at stake? You have to develop these capabilities internally: in the way you plan strategically, sense the market, and anticipate threats. Not every company can do this.</p>\n' +
				'<p>Some companies make acquisitions in order to self-disrupt, but I’d rather develop a mindset from the inside. A lot of businesses have people with vision, but they fail to translate that imagination into concrete steps within the organization. The best know something nobody else knows, and they make sure they act on it.</p>\n' +
				'<h3>What skills do companies to self-disrupt?</h3>\n' +
				"<p>Part of the role I play in Thales is to span boundaries. I’ll go outside our boundaries to sense what's happening in industries that are very far from the core business: “This is what’s happening in the entertainment business, and this is what could mean for us in five years.” You look at companies that are making diversification and strategic moves that are not being triggered by current market conditions.</p>\n" +
				"<p>This goes back to the paper by <a href='https://hbr.org/2009/12/the-innovators-dna?sp=true'>Clayton Christensen</a> on the innovator&rsquo;s DNA. You need the ability to associate, network, sense, and connect things. And those are skills you find in very innovative, creative people, with different sets of skills as far as business acumen is concerned. It depends on the cultural DNA of the company, but typically these people are in innovation or strategic-planning teams.</p>\n" +
				'<h3>How do you avoid complacency?</h3>\n' +
				"<p>Typically, companies that are profitable and have very deep roots in legacy businesses tend to avoid introspection and tend to be in autopilot mode. But they need to embrace skeptics and naysayers. They need to defer to experts who have the real knowledge, and they need to trust them. They need cognitive diversity: the ability to challenge each other candidly without getting into conflict. <span class='quote left'>A lot of businesses have people with vision, but they fail to translate that imagination into concrete steps within the organization. </span> Diversity on the board is as important as diversity in the C-suite to be able to self-disrupt.</p>\n" +
				'<p>Successful companies accept that they have different opinions, but converge towards a vision. Everybody used to look at GE and 3M as machines of self-disruption. They managed the portfolio, they divested when it was high, and reinvested. 3M is still doing this. It’s a way of life because it has an ingrained spirit of innovation.</p>\n' +
				"<p>That&rsquo;s harder in companies with a traditional engineering focus, that are product-oriented and serving traditional markets. At Thales, we have invested a lot in international development (including building local footprint abroad) because we see the future outside of the big eight countries that we typically play in. And we've made big bets in predictable and reliable AI &ndash; we call it <a href='https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/journalist/thales-podcasts?sp=true'>TrUE AI</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n" +
				'<h3>How do you avoid becoming an industry follower?</h3>\n' +
				"<p>Most often, a market leader makes the first move and then others tend to follow. The key is to do this before it's too destructive for the industry or before passing the point of no return. The airline industry is an example where they constantly price too low and enter a bidding war. If you look at the US market, there are only four major airlines. That consolidation could be a consequence of a lack of self-disruption.</p>\n" +
				'<p>In contrast, Volvo has stated that it is aiming for five million direct consumer relationships by 2025. It’s a bold move in a traditional sector – breaking the dealership structure – but often, that’s just the kind of strategy you need.</p>\n' +

				"<h3 class='subtitle'>PMI’s self-disruption journey</h3>" +
				'<i>Self-disruption is not just about a switch from one product to another, or even one industry to another. It is a proactive and fundamental change in a company’s philosophy, ambitions and operations.</i>\n' +
				'<p>Sometimes self-disruption can create short-term challenges. For example, a new product or service may impact a core revenue stream. However, companies that engage in self-disruption understand that major change is needed to safeguard long-term growth.</p>\n' +
				"<p>Philip Morris International (PMI) is in the midst of its own self-disruption journey, one that represents a historic shift for the organization. Since 1847, when Mr. Philip Morris opened a shop on London’s Bond Street, the company has sold conventional tobacco products via conventional channels.  <figure class='inline-article-image -left'><img src='https://ft.com/brandsuite/scienceofselfdisruption/imgs/article04/deepak-mishra01.jpg'><figcaption>Deepak Mishra, <br> Chief Strategy Officer, <br> Philip Morris International</figcaption></figure> Now the organization is undergoing an unprecedented transformation, from a cigarette manufacturer to a science- and technology-driven company.</p>\n" +
				'<p>In 2016, PMI announced its vision to deliver a smoke-free future and replace cigarettes as soon as possible with better alternatives for adult smokers who would otherwise continue smoking.  The company had a new purpose: to focus its resources on products that are less harmful than continued smoking. The majority of harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke come from burning tobacco, not the tobacco itself, so PMI focused on removing combustion. This led to the creation of smoke-free alternatives that can make acceptable alternatives for those adults who would otherwise continue to smoke.</p>\n' +
				'<p>However, fulfilling this new purpose means reinventing the company and steering it through unknown waters. As Deepak Mishra, PMI’s chief strategy officer says: “We are trying to disrupt our own industry, something which is as inspirational as it is complicated.”</p>\n' +
				'<h3>Goals beyond profits</h3>\n' +
				"<p>So what is the motivation behind such a major shift? According to estimates from the World Health Organization, more than 1 billion people will continue to smoke in 2025<sup>[1]</sup>. Yet, smoking prevention and cessation programs coupled with the array of scientifically substantiated smoke-free alternatives, can make cigarettes obsolete in the near future. “With the right regulatory encouragement and support from civil society,” says André Calantzopoulos, CEO of PMI, “we believe cigarette sales can end within 10 to 15 years in many countries.”<span class='quote'>“We are not talking about a small change; we are talking about a big transformation.” <span class='quote-author'>Jacek Olczak, PMI’s Chief Operating Officer</span></span> </p>\n" +
				'<p>What is important is that legal and regulatory frameworks allow for this. Typically, the pace of product innovation moves faster than regulations. In some industries this does not have a material impact on progress, but in other areas it can represent a major barrier. As Daniel Malan, Assistant Professor of Business Ethics at Trinity Business School, points out: “Regulators seem to be confused by the technology, the speed of change and the ethical implications of new products that do not fit into existing categories.”<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n' +
				'<p>Malan refers to a white paper from the World Economic Forum that suggests a way of dealing with this issue: “The Forum’s white paper argues that the best way to ensure positive outcomes in such a complicated environment is to operate with a clear foundation of values, for example, by focusing on basic principles like human dignity and the common good.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n' +
				'<h3>Disrupting the culture</h3>\n' +
				'<p>PMI is clear that the best choice for adult smokers is to quit tobacco and nicotine altogether. But for those that do not, there are better alternatives, and PMI believes that with the right regulation that helps adult smokers get access to and accurate information about better alternatives, many countries could be smoke-free in 10-15 years.</p>\n' +
				"<p><figure class='inline-article-image -left'><img src='https://ft.com/brandsuite/scienceofselfdisruption/imgs/article04/jacek-olczak-1.jpg'><figcaption>Jacek Olczak, <br> COO, <br> Philip Morris International</figcaption></figure>However, Michael Kunst, Senior Vice President for Commercial Transformation at PMI, says that simply relying on a product to drive the business will no longer be enough. To discover how organizations achieve long-term success amid disruption, PMI needed to explore the wider implications of the changes. This led them to study the pathways forged by companies in completely different industries.</p>\n" +
				'<p>“If you look at the technology, media or entertainment industries, or even retail, there are good examples of companies that we can turn to for inspiration; to see how they differentiate in a world that gets more crowded by the day with information overflow,” says Kunst.</p>\n' +
				'<p>While the businesses in other industries are different, many of the same challenges, opportunities and success factors are relevant. Being open to new areas has been important to PMI’s reinvention. “If you compare how the voice of the company was thought of five years ago, or even three years ago, the difference is like night and day, in terms of how we’ve opened up and are inviting conversations with others,” says PMI’s Chief Operating Officer Jacek Olczak.</p>\n' +
				"<p>“We’ve opened up the windows, we’ve opened up the doors, we’ve let the outside world in,” says Marian Salzman, PMI’s senior vice president for global communications, <figure class='inline-article-image -right'><img src='https://ft.com/brandsuite/scienceofselfdisruption/imgs/article04/marian-salzman.jpg'><figcaption>Marian Salzman, <br> Senior Vice President, <br> Global Comms, <br> Philip Morris International</figcaption></figure> “We’ve taken some bruises, but more often than not, we’ve come out better for the fact that we’ve engaged with this bigger, broader world. And I think we’ve become part of the ongoing dialogue around harm reduction, around companies that can change, around workforces that are becoming more inclusive and diverse.”</p>\n" +
				'<h3>Investing in a long-term vision</h3>\n' +
				'<p>Of course, self-disruption does not happen overnight. Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 7.2 billion into the development and commercialization of smoke-free products. <sup>[4]</sup> The company now employs more than 400 scientists, engineers, and technicians.</p>\n' +
				'<p>This investment is now driving the company’s transformation. PMI has grown net revenues from smoke-free products from 2.7% of overall revenue in 2016 to 18.7% in 2019, and aims for 38% to 42% by 2025. <sup>[5]</sup> By that time, it hopes at least 40 million adult smokers will have switched to smoke-free products.</p>\n' +
				'<p>Self-disruption can – by design – affect an existing core business. This is the case for PMI, where smoke-free products are rapidly replacing cigarettes. This can be seen in the company’s results, where by the end of June 2020, year-to-date shipment volume of smoke-free products was up by 33.4%, while cigarette shipment volume was down by 11.4%. <sup>[6]</sup></p>\n' +
				'<p>“Transformation is enormously expensive,” says Martin King, CEO of PMI America. “Most startups get the chance to spend like crazy and everybody gives them a pass, but we have to deliver financial results at least as good as we used to, while investing in all the transformation.”</p>\n' +
				'<p>PMI is working full speed to deliver a smoke-free future. This can happen faster if conversations and debate center on data and scientific evidence, and if governments create regulations that acknowledge these smoke-free products are better than continued smoking and encourage adults who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to them.</p>\n' +
				'<p>Investment, scientific research, communication, external stakeholder engagement, cultural change – all these aspects of self-disruption will need to continue for PMI to achieve its transformation objectives. While there has been progress along PMI’s self-disruption path to date, Kunst says there is still much to do: “It’s a massive change, and therefore it needs repetition, reinforcement, and continued support.”</p>\n' +

				'<i>Sergio Gutiérrez Lázaro-Carrasco, digital strategy and transformation manager at Bridgestone, explains how the world-famous tire company embarked on a new journey</i>\n' +
				'<h3>When was the right time for starting your disruptive journey?</h3>\n' +
				'<p>The rapid commoditization of the tire industry was the prompt. With globalization, new Chinese and Korean brands have entered the market and are selling in Europe. Through e-commerce, customers are able to compare prices more easily, which, as with every commodity, tends to focus customers on price rather than performance. That leads to a race to the bottom, eroding our industry’s margins. </p>\n' +
				'<p>The initial reaction to disruption is that ‘this won’t happen to us’. We demonstrated to the business that disruption is not necessarily about Netflix or Spotify but that small but specific disruptions were taking place close to our business, for example in workshop management software. We explained that with commoditization, value lay beyond the tire.</p>\n' +
				'<p>For years at the IAA, [the automotive industry’s largest event], presentations were of physical products like new trucks, or tires. Now 80% of the presentations are software aggregators and forecast planning software that add value to data taken from vehicles. This helped people understand that if we wanted to stay relevant and competitive, we needed to change focus.</p>\n' +
				'<h3>What was the starting point?</h3>\n' +
				'<p>The first step was shifting the company’s vision, which was led from the top. For years, Bridgestone’s mission was to be the number one tire manufacturer in the world. We introduced the notion of becoming a brilliant mobility solutions provider. From there, we started developing new solutions, both for professional fleets and consumers. One example is Mobox, [an all-inclusive flexible subscription for tyres and vehicle maintenance], which is already running and scaling up quite well. </p>\n' +
				'<p>I was part of the disruption, having had a digital transformation career path but no experience in the tire manufacturing industry prior to joining. We started working with agencies and software development companies on the IT department and legacy systems, which had not been done before, and then developing software, which was another breakthrough.</p>\n' +
				'<p>The biggest disruption came with the acquisition of TomTom Telematics because of its size. This was a cornerstone for our transformation into a telematics or mobility solutions provider.</p>\n' +
				'<h3>What are the challenges?</h3>\n' +
				'<p>The biggest challenge is culture. Bridgestone is a company with a rather strong and risk-averse culture. People consider themselves proficient in what they do, and introducing new concepts, products and processes into a system that is already working is always a challenge.</p>\n' +
				'<p>This change was particularly challenging as a switch from tires to software was not, at first sight, self-evident. It was a move to an adjacent market rather than an adjacent product. But we had a compelling story and a strong brand, which helped. </p>\n' +
				"<p>We still needed to nurture our core tire business, while also building the story of the acquisition and the new joint value proposition. We have bold targets and believe this shouldn't disrupt the trajectory in the coming years. And we are also expecting some synergies, which will strengthen our vertical offering. </p>\n" +
				'<h3>How hard was it to convince stakeholders of your strategy?</h3>\n' +
				'<p>Having a clear vision and a clear articulation of that vision, and C-level engagement and support are the key things in terms of external shareholders.</p>\n' +
				'<p>Our previous CEO, Paolo Ferrari, was quite a visionary and a true change agent. He and now the C-level executives were able to articulate the clear reasoning behind the vision, which helped shareholders to understand why investments in the short term are needed to unlock greater value in the future. </p>\n' +
				"<p>Internally, the salesforce is also key. We are expanding their knowledge into the telematics industry and our joint value proposition, bit by bit, step-by-step. And this comes with proper sales and incentive schemes. Ultimately, the salesforce is about selling and that's the same in every organization. Figuring out the best incentive scheme, and evolving it as the organization evolves into new products is one of the key things.</p>\n" +
				'<h3>How do you measure success?</h3>\n' +
				"<p>When I joined, the overall idea was to keep measuring the revenues and profits of these new digital solutions. But traditional metrics or measures don't necessarily apply with innovation.</p>\n" +
				"<p>Right now, it's not about the operating profit, because any start up is non-profitable at first. It's about growth. We monitor customer base growth, acquisition and retention, to help understand scalability. Once that's established, we will refocus on sales and operating profit margins. But this is a goal. In the meantime, you need to work in both worlds and have that equilibrium between the two sides of the coin. You can try to embed it all together and have the same processes for both business lines, but it makes no sense. If you force it, you will frustrate those people working on the new business. </p>\n" +

				'<p>The answer may lie in the lessons learned by manufacturers more than a century ago. In 1900, 95% of mechanical power in factories still came from steam, even though Thomas Edison had opened the first commercial electricity generating stations two decades earlier.</p>\n' +
				'<p>The arrival of electricity offered a step-change in productivity – yet many early adopters struggled to earn a return on their investments. Others decided to hold back. </p>\n' +
				'<p>The problem wasn’t that manufacturers were wedded to steam power. While steam had driven the industrial revolution, with huge engines powering vast factories, production was unwieldy. Every part of the factory was connected to a single drive shaft, so for even just one machine to run, the whole system had to operate. Steam-powered facilities were expensive to fuel, prone to breakdowns, dirty and dangerous.</p>\n' +
				'<p>Yet at first sight, electricity did not appear to offer much of an improvement. It was certainly possible to swap out the giant steam engine powering the drive shaft for an electric motor, but the factory remained just as cumbersome. Manufacturers that made such investments found the gains were marginal at best.</p>\n' +
				'<p>The problem was that simply exchanging steam power for electricity was an exercise in technology renewal but not, in itself, a disruptive act. To really harness the potential of electricity, manufacturers had to think about how it could enable them to reorganise their businesses.</p>\n' +
				'<p>Above all, electricity enabled small-scale, precision manufacturing. While small steam engines were too inefficient to be commercially viable, small electric motors worked very well. Suddenly, each part of the factory could be powered independently, dialling production up or down as required.</p>\n' +
				'<p>Even better, because electricity was delivered through wires, rather than requiring a facility in which every machine had to be connected to the driveshaft, it was possible to completely redesign the factory. Facilities could be lighter and more airy – better places to work – and, most importantly from an economic perspective, they could be designed around the idea of a production line.</p>\n' +
				'<p>It was this principle that underpinned the mass production system designed by Henry Ford, the pioneer of the modern industrial assembly line. Ford built his own electricity generating power plant on his River Rouge site in Michigan in order to power the Highland Park facility where the Model T was produced on a massive scale. </p>\n' +
				'<p>Another significant impact of working in these new ways was that manufacturers’ employees had more autonomy and flexibility. Skill levels increased and employers focused on quality of employee rather than quantity. They had to invest in training and pay higher wages – Ford caused shockwaves when he announced a minimum wage of $5 an hour, double the going rate, and a working day of eight hours rather than the standard 12. The pay-off was a far superior workforce capable of much-increased productivity and continuing innovation.</p>\n' +
				'<p>the disruptive potential of electricity reaped the benefits. In 1921, with the US mired in recession, the Ford Motor Company sold 845,000 vehicles and made a profit of $75m – the equivalent of $1.9bn today.</p>\n' +
				'<p>By contrast, manufacturers that stuck with steam, or changed their source of power without rethinking their production processes, were left behind. Manufacturing productivity in the US in the 1920s rose by an average of 5.2% a year, four times faster than productivity in the agricultural sector. Manufacturers had finally recognised that electricity was not simply a replacement technology, but a means with which to completely reinvent their businesses.</p>\n' +

				"<p>Bernard Kroger could have taught 21st century retailers a thing or two about disruption. The US businessman&rsquo;s chain of grocery stores grew rapidly during the 1920s as customers embraced his revolutionary idea of <a href='https://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Kroger_Company?sp=true' target='_blank' >self-service shopping</a>. The innovation of allowing people into stores to choose their merchandise, and then to take it home, quickly displaced the previous norm of shoppers placing an order and waiting for its delivery.</p>\n" +
				"<p>Then, in the 1930s, after Kroger retired, another disruptive force appeared. The company could only watch as a former employee, Michael Cullen, <a href='http://archive.wilsonquarterly.com/in-essence/birth-supermarket?sp=true' target='_blank'>pioneered</a> the supermarket – a much bigger store that would offer a wide range of cheap goods and free parking. Cullen had pitched the concept to Kroger’s board, but it rejected the idea and he went ahead alone. </p>\n" +
				"<p>For modern retailers currently attempting to pick a path through <a href='https://www.ft.com/content/77e366da-dfb6-11e9-b8e0-026e07cbe5b4?sp=true' target='_blank'>challenges</a> such as omnichannel demand, dynamic pricing and the sharing economy, there is a lesson here: theirs is an industry that has always disrupted itself.</p>\n" +
				'<h3>On constant alert</h3>\n' +
				'<p>The huge success of department stores in the first half of the last century – Macy’s and Bloomingdales in the US, for instance, or Selfridges in the UK – rapidly threatened more specialist local stores, particularly as public transport expanded to broaden their reach. </p>\n' +
				"<p>But department stores also had to contend with the disruptive threat of catalogue retailers, which enabled shoppers to place orders from the comfort of their own homes. In the UK, <a href='https://www.littlewoods.com/our-history.page?sp=true' target='_blank'></a>\n" +
				'<p>In the post-war years, the advent of shopping malls introduced new dangers for more isolated department stores. So too did the arrival of the discounters from the 1970s onwards. Brands ranging from Costco and Target to Home Depot and Toys R Us invested in technology and focused on commoditization in order to undercut their incumbent rivals.</p>\n' +
				'<p>By the time ecommerce started to make an impression in the 1990s, the retail industry had already been through wave after wave of disruption. Each wave had its winners and losers.</p>\n' +
				'<h3>Ecommerce will not stand still</h3>\n' +
				"<p>Ecommerce was not a particularly new idea: in 1979, the British entrepreneur and inventor <a href='https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/business-24109101?sp=true' target='_blank'>Michael Aldrich</a> modified a normal television in order to connect it via a telephone line to a computer; the technology, through which electronic orders could be placed, was widely used for business-to-business transactions throughout the 1980s. But online sales did not take off until the commercialization of the internet made it accessible to the mass market – just as trains and buses were taking customers to department stores 100 years previously.</p>\n" +
				"<p>The Covid-19 pandemic may be another such catalyst. Before the crisis, online sales as a percentage of total retail sales were increasing steadily but relatively slowly – in the UK, from 2.8% in 2006 to 19.1% by February 2020 according to <a href='https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/retailindustry/timeseries/j4mc/drsi?sp=true' target='_blank'>the Office for National Statistics</a>. By January 2021, while the country was in lockdown, that figure peaked at 36.5%. It then fell back as the country opened up, but at 26.2% (in July 2021) it still represents a massive shift towards online.</p>\n" +
				"<p>But online retail will also be disrupted by new ideas and innovations. Take Amazon Fresh&rsquo;s new range of grocery stores with no tills, which have started to open in the US and in <a href='https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56266494?sp=true' target='_blank'>London</a>. Shoppers announce their arrival in the store with a smartphone app, take products from the shelves and put them straight into their bags, and then leave the store without having to queue at a checkout. <br /><br />Their phone registers what they have taken, and they are billed automatically. Remarkably, Amazon, the dominant name in global ecommerce, appears to be betting on a more frictionless experience reinvigorating physical retail. In the process, it may also find a way to tackle online shopping&rsquo;s problems &ndash; rising delivery costs and returns.<br /><br /></p>\n" +
				"<p>Other retailers are exploring different types of disruption. In the consumer goods sector, for example, the established business model for global giants ranging from Nike to Pepsi has been wholesale: they build awareness with massive marketing spend that challengers cannot match, and sell through partners such as department stores and supermarkets. But in an era where small brands can build their own base with targeted social media activity, size no longer automatically delivers dominance, and the big brands are finding themselves forced to compete on price. Their response, increasingly, is to shift to a direct-to-consumer model &ndash; see Nike&rsquo;s <a href='https://www.voguebusiness.com/consumers/nike-retail-strategy-direct-to-consumer-house-of-innovation?sp=true' target='_blank'>investment</a> in its own stores, Pepsi&rsquo;s <a href='https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pepsico-launches-new-direct-to-consumer-offerings-to-deliver-food--beverage-products-and-meet-increased-demand-amid-pandemic-301056539.html?sp=true' target='_blank'>launch</a> of PantryShop.com and Snacks.com, and the <a href='https://www.stylus.com/heinz-launches-directtoconsumer-bundle-delivery-service#:~:text=Food%20giant%20Heinz%20has%20launched,them%20delivered%20to%20their%20door.&amp;text=Going%20forward%2C%20Heinz%20also%20aims,containing%20sauces%20and%20baby%20products.?sp=true' target='_blank'>Heinz to Home</a> initiative.</p>\n" +
				'<h3>Hitch a ride on innovation</h3>\n' +
				'<p>The experience of a century and more of disruption in the retail sector is that it is not easy to identify winning models in advance. Just ask the Kroger board, or Blockbuster. Ideas that extend choice, improve service or reduce cost seem obvious in hindsight, but innovation often comes up short.</p>\n' +
				'<p>But the most successful disruptive retailers have one thing in common. Their ideas for reinvention of their own business model often harness advances elsewhere – whether that is mass transportation systems or internet in the home. The next wave of disruption will be the same, so forward-looking retailers might want to start looking into technologies such as 5G smartphone connectivity, the internet of things and artificial intelligence. These innovations could be the catalysts; the Bernard Krogers of today will be ready to take advantage.</p>\n' +

				'<i>Why do some companies embark on radical change?</i>\n' +
				'<p>In 2020, BP announced a new goal: the company would become net-zero by 2050.</p>\n' +
				'<p>That is a distant target, but for a giant oil and gas company, it requires urgent transformation. By 2030, the company aims to produce 20 times as much renewable energy, while slashing oil and gas production by 40%.<sup>1</sup></p>\n' +
				'<p>BP is undertaking what we call self-disruption. This is where an established organization takes a path of disruptive innovation intended to substantially alter its own core business activities or markets. </p>\n' +
				'<p>This strategy can erode, cannibalize or replace the current core business, but this is deemed necessary for the long-term survival or growth of the organization. Self-disruption is fascinating from many angles, and to learn more we conducted a survey of 510 senior leaders from 21 countries across six continents.</p>\n' +
				'<p>The survey covered innovation, transformation, and self-disruption, and screened-out companies that were not investing in any of these areas to some extent. What we found was that genuine self-disruption is relatively rare, with less than a fifth (17%) of our (already screened) sample reporting strong investment in the strategy over the past five years. </p>\n' +
				'<p>Our research has revealed several interesting factors that distinguish this 17% – which we will call the “Self-disruptors” – from the 39% of respondents – the “Maintainers” – that report low investment in self-disruption. </p>\n' +
				"<p>Over the course of this article <a href='https://www.ft.com/partnercontent/scienceofselfdisruption/#9?sp=true'>and its sequel</a>, these differences help to reveal some common characteristics of Self-disruptors, and to shed light on the question of why some companies choose to self-disrupt at all. </p>\n" +
				'<h3>Self-disruption across industries </h3>\n' +
				'<p>Respondents in our survey were from five different industries, and this naturally seems to play a role in driving self-disruption, with some industries changing more than others.</p>\n' +
				'<p>For example, half of all the Self-disruptors in our survey were from two of the five industries, energy and technology, with each accounting for around a quarter of the group. By contrast, only 11% were from the healthcare industry, an inherently more conservative sector.</p>\n' +
				'<p>There are no significant differences between the two groups when analyzed by region, but size does seem to matter. A higher proportion of Self-disruptors (36%) have annual revenue in excess of US$1bn, compared to 23% of Maintainers. This may be because larger companies will often benefit from the scale and budget to have dedicated innovation labs, strategy teams and change management functions.</p>\n' +
				'<p>But the differences by size and industry only scratch the surface. For instance, if we were to examine only similar-sized companies from a single industry, how would we then understand why some self-disrupt and others do not?</p>' +
				"<div class='content__item-text__img -small'><img style='object-fit: contain'; src='https://ft.com/partnercontent/pmi/img/article08/graph01.png'/></div>" +
				'<h3>Scars and threats</h3>\n' +
				'<p>One of the most distinctive features we found is that far more Self-disruptors than Maintainers have been disrupted by an innovative start-up within the past 10 years. They also remain more concerned about the threat of further disruptive innovations, and many more say their organization believes in the mantra of &ldquo;disrupt or be disrupted.&rdquo; With BP, for example, there are many disruptive contenders, as billions are invested in the full spectrum of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies.<sup>2</sup></p>\n' +
				'<p>Perhaps as a result of this arms-race mentality, Self-disruptors have developed capabilities that can help them overcome these threats. Almost all have a team or unit specially dedicated to innovation, while over eight-in-ten have invested in research or data tools that help them predict the impact of innovation, core business transformation or self-disruption.</p>\n' +

				'<h3>Regulatory certainty</h3>\n' +
				'<p>We also learned that regulations are a much more important driver of self-disruption, innovation and transformation for Self-disruptors than for Maintainers. This is despite the fact that similar majorities in both groups say that their industry is heavily regulated. </p>\n' +
				'<p>The difference then, could be more to do with the perceived likelihood or frequency of major regulatory changes. This is probably part of the reason why Self-disruptors believe that regulators will play a bigger role in the success of their transformation or innovation strategy than Maintainers do.  </p>\n' +
				'<p>But importantly, they also believe, to a greater extent than Maintainers, that regulatory change is driven by scientific evidence in their industry. This is an important finding for regulators, especially those that aim to foster innovation and transformation. Evidence-driven regulation appears to give Self-disruptors greater certainty around the direction of regulatory change, and therefore greater confidence when considering investments in response to it.</p>\n' +

				'<p>What kind of company would invest in disruptive innovations that, if successful, would displace or replace its most lucrative business area?</p>\n' +
				'<p>This kind of strategy is what we call self-disruption. It is where an established organization takes a path of disruptive innovation intended to substantially alter its own core business activities or markets.</p>\n' +
				'<p>But what differentiates self-disruption from other change strategies, is that the process can erode, cannibalize or replace the current core business. Despite this, self-disruption is necessary for long-term growth. It is therefore a strategy requiring an unusual combination of courage and prudence.</p>\n' +
				"<p>In <a href='https://www.ft.com/partnercontent/scienceofselfdisruption/#8?sp=true'>part 1 of this two-part feature</a>, we shared some of the results of our research into the nature of self-disruption, based on a survey of 510 senior leaders from 21 countries across six continents. </p>\n" +
				'<p>The survey finds that true self-disruption is uncommon, with less than a fifth (17%) of respondents reporting strong investment in the strategy over the past five years. It is important to note that the true number would be smaller still, because our sample was already a subset of the natural population of companies: to qualify, respondents needed to indicate that their organization was actively investing – to some extent – in any of innovation, core business transformation, or self-disruption. </p>\n' +
				'<p>As in part 1, in this article we will refer to this 17% as the “Self-disruptors,” and the contrasting group – the “Maintainers” – are the 39% that report low investment in self-disruption.</p>\n' +
				'<h3>Industry leaders common in both camps</h3>\n' +
				'<p>Our survey tested many hypotheses for the drivers of self-disruption and key characteristics of self-disruptive firms. While we are mostly focused on the loudest and clearest signals, it is interesting to highlight a couple here that were (somewhat surprisingly) unsupported.</p>\n' +
				'<p>For instance, at the outset, we wondered if some organizations are just better at managing internal transformations and major change, and so (all things being equal) they would have more of a leaning towards a program of self-disruption.</p>\n' +
				'<p>This was not the case in our survey. Similar majorities in both groups believe their organizations are good at such things, with only a small edge to the Self-disruptors. </p>\n' +
				'<p>Perhaps Self-disruptors are among the leaders in their respective industries? Their competitive and financial advantages could support a drive to self-disrupt. Again, this looks like a less central factor, with Self-disruptors only modestly more likely to be industry leaders than Maintainers. Indeed, it is often very difficult to risk an industry-leading position to pursue disruptive innovation.<sup>1</sup></p>\n' +
				"<div class='content__item-text__img -small'><img style='object-fit: contain'; src='https://ft.com/partnercontent/pmi/img/article09/graph01.png'/></div>" +
				'<h3>Driven to disruption</h3>\n' +
				'<p>We see more compelling clues when we compare what drives companies to pursue any kind of innovation or transformation. For example, Self-disruptors rate the major breakthroughs they have made internally as the top driver of their change and innovation strategy.</p>\n' +
				'<p>An example of this is the Finnish telecommunications company, Nokia – a company that has reinvented itself several times in its history. </p>\n' +
				'<p>During the 1960s and ‘70s, Nokia company focused almost all efforts on paper, rubber, and cables. However, during this time, Nokia nurtured a tiny electronics division in the corner of one of its cable factories. This division would go on to produce the innovations that helped transform the company into a telecommunications giant in the 1980s and ‘90s.<sup>2</sup></p>\n' +
				'<p>By contrast, Maintainers, to the extent that they are changing and innovating, are driven more by external factors. The top two are: changes in consumer preferences, and the increasing strength of competitors. </p>\n' +
				'<p>These are important factors for Self-disruptors too, but their drivers are more balanced between the internal and external factors. Maintainers tend to change mostly when forced by some external pressure. </p>\n' +
				"<div class='content__item-text__img -small'><img style='object-fit: contain'; src='https://ft.com/partnercontent/pmi/img/article09/graph02.png'/></div>" +
				'<h3>Broader perspectives on success</h3>\n' +
				'<p>There is another major difference between Self-disruptors and Maintainers, potentially the most thought-provoking of them all.</p>\n' +
				'<p>We asked respondents to tell us which metrics were most important when their organization evaluated the success or failure of innovation, core business transformation or self-disruption. </p>\n' +
				'<p>Maintainers focus more on traditional business performance, rating profitability and operational efficiency above all other factors. </p>\n' +
				'<p>These factors are important for Self-disruptors too, but environmental impact and employee satisfaction (or engagement) get a similar level of priority. And the most important metric of all for Self-disruptors? A positive impact on society. </p>\n' +
				"<div class='content__item-text__img -small'><img style='object-fit: contain'; src='https://ft.com/partnercontent/pmi/img/article09/graph03.png'/></div>" +
				'<h3>Beyond the bottom line </h3>\n' +
				'<p>It is interesting to consider what the link could be between making a positive impact on society – as well as the priority of the environment and employees – and the propensity of a company to invest in self-disruption? Are these traits just correlated, or is there a causal link, where these traits might make self-disruption more likely? </p>\n' +
				'<p>For example, a company that is focused on society, its employees and the environment (to the same extent as profits) may perceive more reasons to change than a company narrowly focused on business performance. </p>\n' +
				'<p>Similarly, these organizations may have a more outward-looking perspective in general, leaving them less susceptible to the navel-gazing that can lead companies to react too slowly to disruptive threats.</p>\n' +
				'<h3>A positive profile</h3>\n' +
				'<p>We know, then, that external drivers – like industry trends, regulations, competition and changes to customer needs – are important to self-disruption. But crucially, that Self-disruptors are quite likely to have the strategy emerge from within – from moments of inspiration and hours of perspiration within a dedicated innovation function (a capability which almost all Self-disruptors have in place, as we saw in part 1).</p>\n' +
				"<p>We also know from <a href='https://www.ft.com/partnercontent/scienceofselfdisruption/#8?sp=true'>part 1</a> that fear is a key motivator for self-disruption – the fear that another company will disrupt the industry first. And while Self-disruptors they may feel they are in an arms race, it is a fair one, because they feel quite strongly that their organization is governed by regulations which are supported by science.  </p>\n" +
				'<p>Finally, it is encouraging to discover that self-disruptive organizations are potentially a powerful positive force in the world. They are open to change, by definition, but this could have turned out to be purely self-serving change, with potentially negative effects. Instead, our research shows that most Self-disruptors recognize the importance of human factors, of responsibility and of the impact they have on the world beyond their walls. </p>\n' +
